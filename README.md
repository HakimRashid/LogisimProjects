The CPU compiler only works with the .circ file titled 8085. My first ever attempt at creating a CPU was with the CPU.circ file. Over the years I made newer versions with the final being 8085.circ. The 8085.circ file includes the 8085 complemented with the 80237 DMA and 8255 I/O Controller. All three almost near-perfect replicas in function. However, I made personal architectural revisions to ensure they behave as closely as possible to their real-life counterparts. I made a few demos in all revisions utilizing the TTY subcircuit in logisim to display text.
